Notes[edit],,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
"1. ^ Calculated, when available, from the latest national censuses or most recent official estimates (many of which are cited in their respective column), using the exponential formula shown on the List of countries by past and future population article. This is done to normalize the different populations to a unique date, so that they are really comparable.",,,,,,,,,
2. ^ It corresponds to the following formula: projection2015/projection2014x100-100.,,,,,,,,,
3. ^ It corresponds to the calculation: projection2015*annual_growth/100.,,,,,,,,,
"4. ^ It corresponds to the formula: LN(2)/LN(growth/100+1), which produces exactly the same result as LOG10(2)/LOG10(growth/100+1).",,,,,,,,,
"5. ^ It excludes the population of the disputed territory of the Western Sahara (the so-called Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. If it was included, the Moroccan September 2014 census would result in 33,848,242 inhabitants and its mid-2015 demographic projection would give some 34,198,000 inhab.",,,,,,,,,
"6. ^ Administration is split between Morocco and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, both of which claim the entire territory.",,,,,,,,,
